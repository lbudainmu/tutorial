= Fun with Wireshark

Author: Lajos Budai

== Intro

This tutorial will give a basic idea on WireShark. It will introduce how to setup filters and how to capture unencrypted traffic and why is it way better to use encrypted websites.

== Learning objectives
* Capture network traffic in our machine
* Analyze the most common used unsecured traffic
* Setting up some basic filters on Wireshark

== Prerequisites

* Windows computer
* Internet connection
* Wireshark
* Connections to nmu network via wifi or lte ( for lesson 3)
* Download these files:

```


== Instructions

== Lesson one

Lets visit a website where we can reconstruct the website by following the tcp/http stream.

* Open the http.cap file
* Set up the filter to only show http traffic ( this is optional, it just help us to learn the filter)

* Now clik on the followings

Now we can see the whole html code, with this information we can reconstruct the whole website.

== Lesson two

It is very simple to save pictures from an unencrypted website as well.

* Let sopen the http_with_jpegs.cap.gz file
* Open Export Objects, HTTP

* Find an image file and simply save it.

== Lesson three


Now let's connect to the NMU FTP server

* Go to File Explorer and find [lbudai] on myweb.nmu.edu [this should be your nmuid]
* If it asks your username and password you are all set and you can skip the next bulletpoint
* Create a random txt file, and upload it in here. Now delete the file from your computer, and try to open the file from your nmu server.
* Start capturing the traffic on the interface where we see traffic.

* Now we will have way more traffic, so lets make sure to type ftp to the filter bar.

* The following packets should be in front of us.

Now behind the white-black rectangle my password for nmu is hiding. Anyone who could capture this data, can see my very sensitive password. Using FTP without encryption is a bad practice.


== Challenge

* Lets capture some real traffic. Go and visit some comonly used websites. Can you find any useful information?
* Try to find a website with unencrypted traffic, and try to figure out the context by using wireshark, and try to save down some images.

== Reflection

* What do you think about unencrypted wireless traffic? Can someone capture these kind of traffics from the "air"?
